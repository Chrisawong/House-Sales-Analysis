# Summary
Online property companies use machine learning techniques to provide house valuations. This project aims to predict house sales in King County, Washington State, USA using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The dataset includes historical records of houses sold between May 2014 and May 2015. This project was created by Christopher Wong, for Professor You Liang (course MTH404).

Utilized tidyverse, corrplot, lubridate, caTools, GGally, caret, and leaps libraries for analysis & model building.

The data for this project was sourced from the Kaggle dataset titled “KC_Housesales_Data”. 
The dataset can be accessed at: https://www.kaggle.com/swathiachath/kc-housesales-data

# Project Highlights
Prepared a dataset of 21,000+ records, conducting exploratory analysis (R) to identify patterns, relationships, and outliers.

Created visualizations (e.g. correlation matrices) to support findings and enhance interpretability.

Developed a Multiple Linear Regression model to forecast house prices based on key features like square footage and location.

Assessed model performance and compared results with a one-layer forward neural network as a baseline reference.
